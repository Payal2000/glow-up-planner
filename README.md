## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 15 (App Router) |
| Auth + Database | Supabase (Postgres + RLS) |
| AI | OpenAI `gpt-4o-mini` |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS |
| Animations | Framer Motion |
| Language | TypeScript |

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and install
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd glow-up-planner
npm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
Create a `.env.local` file in the project root:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

> `OPENAI_API_KEY` is server-only — never prefix it with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.

### 3. Set up the database
Run the following tables in your Supabase SQL editor:

- `daily_plans` — daily planner + timetable data
- `habit_weeks` — weekly habit completion grid
- `habit_settings` — custom habit list per user
- `job_applications` — job tracker rows
- `meal_entries` — food diary entries per date
- `meal_settings` — calorie goal per user
- `meal_coach_logs` — saved AI meal coach results

All tables require RLS with `auth.uid() = user_id` policies.

### 4. Run locally
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deploying to Vercel

1. Push to GitHub
2. Import the repo at [vercel.com/new](https://vercel.com/new)
3. Add environment variables in **Project Settings → Environment Variables**:
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`
4. In **Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration**, add your Vercel URL as a redirect URL: `https://your-project.vercel.app/**`
5. Deploy

## AI Agents

All AI features call server-side API routes so the OpenAI key never reaches the client.

| Agent | Route | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| Daily Brief | `/api/agent/daily-brief` | 150-word morning briefing from today's data |
| Habit Analysis | `/api/agent/habit-analysis` | 4-week habit pattern report |
| Weekly Wrap-Up | `/api/agent/weekly-wrap` | Weekly review auto-saved to Sunday notes |
| Study Plan | `/api/agent/study-plan` | 5-day LeetCode plan from your tracking data |
| Cold Outreach | `/api/agent/cold-outreach` | 3-sentence LinkedIn DM per job application |
| Meal Coach | `/api/agent/meal-coach` | Daily/weekly nutrition analysis, food research, Q&A |
